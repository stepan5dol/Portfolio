Historical data analysis conducted by combining DS and Medical skills. Feature engineering used to find new patterns of connections between modifyable risk factors and target feature. ML model with `>95% ROC-AUC` score was built and tested to predict Low body weight in newborns.

Each project in numerical order reflects the `stages of studying` aspects of the Data Scientist profession. Most of projects were based on real data. All projects were aimed to train specific skill: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Time Series`, `ML`, `NLP`, `CV`, `SQL` etc.
